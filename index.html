        <h1> Reflection. </h1>
<p id="fel"> Hello World. <br>
I am Felix. <br>
You may know me as a creator of pinekeys, or you may know me personally. <br>
Either way, it has come to my attention that there have been certain... security risks... <br>
Recently, a few students have come to me personally, and have started to blackmail me with my  identity. <br> 
'Not a big deal, we all know who you are anyway!' <br>
That's slightly concerning at worse, and completely frightening at best. <br>
Anyway, let me give you my life story. <br>

I, the founder of pinekeys actually started this to test my coding skills, the first website I made was KeysCreator, you may or made not of heard of it. After unknown student decided to get the website blocked, I took upon myself to find two colleagues (Pineapple and Hamper) to revamp the site in a new form, giving birth to the website today, Pinekeys. Well now, you may be asking, 'Why are you giving us your whole life story? We don't care at all.". And, I'm here to say that hamper, pineapple, and I will be shutting down pinekeys by the time you see this.

At the end of this whole document there will be a link to a poll. If we reach more than 20 "Yes" votes, we will reupload the site, and continue working on it (Given than the 20 'yes' votes outweigh the 'no' votes.

That's all from me, onto Pineapple. </p>

<p id="pine"> Hello Everyone. You probably know me as Pineapple. You may be wondering what happened to this. So let's start at the beginning. I started working on key creator when felix invited me to work on it after he saw my forked project (Which was not good). But I knew Felix from before as an acquaintance, so I was a bit hesitant but I thought, eh why not. Well a lot of things happened. Then our first website got banned. But then we luckily were able to make our new website, Pinekeys, Better than ever. With new ui and more game sites and even a discord. But our mistake is we started adding some password locked stuff. So only people we trust will be able to use it. Well people started to get crazy. They were trying to blackmail us with our identities (you know who you are) just so they could get the passwords. We realized that this is too much and we have decided to shut down the website. Thank you for understanding.

<p id="ham"> Greetings, I'm HAMPER, your resident UI enthusiast. As of late, the incessant barrage of requests for passwords and sensitive information has reached an overwhelming point. After careful consideration, I've come to the decision to discontinue my involvement in such matters. It's become apparent that maintaining a balance between user engagement and safeguarding private information has become increasingly challenging.

It's disheartening to witness the continuous demand for confidential data, and I believe it's in the best interest of all parties involved to bring this chapter to a close. My primary focus has always been on enhancing user experiences and contributing positively to the community. Unfortunately, the persistent requests for passwords have compromised the integrity of these efforts.

I want to express my gratitude to those who have supported and appreciated my contributions. However, it's time for me to step away from this situation. I bid you farewell. If you have any further inquiries unrelated to sensitive information, feel free to reach out. Thank you for your understanding. - Probably ChatGPT made this idk <p>
